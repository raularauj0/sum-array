## problem description
Write a function that takes an array of numbers and returns the sum of the numbers. The numbers can be negative or non-integer. If the array does not contain any numbers then you should return 0.

Examples
Input: [1, 5.2, 4, 0, -1]
Output: 9.2

Input: []
Output: 0

Input: [-2.398]
Output: -2.398

Assumptions
You can assume that you are only given numbers.
You cannot assume the size of the array.
You can assume that you do get an array and if the array is empty, return 0.
What We're Testing
We're testing basic loops and math operations. This is for beginners who are just learning loops and math operations.
Advanced users may find this extremely easy and can easily write this in one line.

### Domain

- should give me the result some the all numbers
- only numbers
- if given number is empty the result will be 0
- you cannot assume the limit of given numbers

## pomodoro 1

- test ('should return sum of two numbers')
- create code in prod
- test ('should return sum of two numbers when there are negative')
- create code in prod
- test (return 0 when the array is empty)
- create prod code

## pomodoro 2
- test (should return the same number when array have one number)
- create code in prod
- refactor the code to recive loop 
- test (should return the sum of many numbers)
